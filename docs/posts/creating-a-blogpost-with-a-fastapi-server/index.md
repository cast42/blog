I copied the idea from [https://github.com/koaning/flask-blogposter/tree/main](https://github.com/koaning/flask-blogposter/tree/main)

and vibe coded it into a [FlaskAPI](https://flask-api.github.io/flask-api/) app.

I reorganized the directory structure and used the uv package manager as explained in this video [My 2025 uv-based Python Project Layout for Production Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFyE9xgeKcA)

The repository on github is found here: [blog](https://github.com/cast42/blog)
