I was just reading the article [The walled garden cracks: Nadella bets Microsoft’s Copilots—and Azure’s next act—on A2A/MCP interoperability](https://search.app/6hpcF) and this is how I see what's happening in the AI landscape:

- **Antropic**: best user experience and defined MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction))
- **Google**: best model on all leaderboards with Gemini and defined A2A ([Agent-to-Agent](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/))
- **Microsoft**: let's build an open AI ecosystem with MCP and A2A, releases [supports for A2A](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2025/05/07/empowering-multi-agent-apps-with-the-open-agent2agent-a2a-protocol/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and [MCP in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- **Deepseek**: after they pulled of DeepSeek V3, Deepseek released open model DeepSeek-Prover-V2 that tackles advanced theorem proving achieving an 88.9% pass rate on the MiniF2F-test benchmark (Olympiad/AIME level theorems) and solving 49 out of 658 problems on the new PutnamBench. This means that Deepseek is cracking the reasoning part of LLM's.

And **OpenAI**:

- Let us make Gibli images
- We are not Open anymore because we need to much VC budget. Euhm, actually we want to be open again and let's hire instagram CEO to clean up our mess
- Here's GPT4.5 preview, euhm, actually GPT 4.1 is better....
- Buys ~~Cursour~~ ![Windsurf]([url](url))

Seeing all those signals, we conclude: the AI future will be open!
