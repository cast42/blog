# My talk at data science leuven

Links to video and slides of the talk and thanking people.


## Talk material

On 23 April 2020, I was invited for a talk at [Data science Leuven](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/Data-Science-Leuven/).
I talked about how you can explore and explain the results of a clustering exercise.
The target audience are data scientists that that have notions of how to cluster data and that want to improve their skills.


The video is recorded on Youtube:

  You can see the slides here: [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNcbzKXeRWiTbevgsb1GtlPpBale8iKQjQV-BcSS1Vk/edit?usp=sharing)



The talk itself is based on this [notebook](https://cast42.github.io/blog/datascience/python/clustering/altair/shap/2020/04/23/explain-clusters-to-business.html) that I published on this blog yesterday and that I used to demo during the talk.

The host of the conference was [Istvan Hajnal](https://twitter.com/IstvanHajnal). He tweeted the following:

He also took the R out of my family name NachteRgaele. Troubles with R, it's becoming a story of my life... :joy: Behind the scene [Kris Peeters](https://twitter.com/peeterskris) calmly took the heat of doing the live streaming. :+1: Almost Pydata quality! Big thanks to the whole Data Science Leuven team that is doing all this on voluntary basis.



## Standing on the shoulders of the giants

This talks was not possible without the awesome [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) visualisation library made by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/). Secondly, it builds upon the open source [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) library made by Scott Lundberg. Those two libraries had a major impact on my daily work as datascientist at Colruyt group. They inspired me in trying to give back to the open source community with this talk. :metal:

If you want to learn how to use Altair I recommend the tutorial made by [Vincent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88) on his calm code site: [https://calmcode.io/altair/introduction.htm](https://calmcode.io/altair/introduction.htm)

I would also like to thank my collegues at work who endured the dry-run of this talk and who made the suggestion to try to use a classifier to explain the clustering result. Top team!



## Awesome fastpages

Finally, this blog is build with the awesome fastpages. I can now share a rendered Jupyter notebook, with working interactive demos, that can be opened in [My binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) with one click on a button. This means that readers can directly tinker around with the code and methods discussed in the talk. All you need is a browser and an internet connection. So thank you [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward), [Hamel Husain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain), and the [fastdotai](https://twitter.com/fastdotai) team for pulling this off.  Thank you [Hamel Husain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) for your Github Actions. I will cast for two how awesome this all is.
