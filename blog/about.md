# About me

![](assets/lode_nachtergaele.jpeg){ align=right }

Welcome to my blog! I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about building intelligent systems and optimizing workflows through automation. I spend most of my days coding in **Python**, experimenting with new **ML models**, and finding efficient ways to deploy AI solutions.

## What I Write About

On this blog, I share insights on:

- **Machine Learning & AI** â€“ model training, deployment strategies, and optimization techniques.
- **MLOps & Cloud Computing** â€“ managing models in production, leveraging tools like **Azure Cosmos DB** and serverless architectures.
- **Software Development** â€“ Python tips, UI development (e.g., using **Reflex.dev**), and database integrations.
- **Cycling & Sports Analytics** â€“ analyzing **lactate production data**, power metrics, and Strava integrations.
- **Personal Projects & Experiments** â€“ such as setting up **MkDocs with GitHub Actions** for this blog!

## Tech I Use

Some of my favorite tools and frameworks include:

- **Hugging Face models** for NLP and embeddings (e.g., `gretelai/gretel-gliner-bi-large-v1.0`, `cde-small-v2`)
- **Gradio** for interactive ML interfaces
- **Mesop**, Flask, and containerized deployments
- **Reflex.dev**

## Let's Connect

Feel free to check out my work on **[GitHub](https://github.com/cast42/blog)** or reach out for a chat about ML, coding, or cycling.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
